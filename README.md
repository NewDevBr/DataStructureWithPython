### Linked List Folder <a name="LinkedListFolder">

Linked list is a linear cell sequence, containing objects of same type.
These elements can be storage in any memory location, because each data
are linked using pointers.

### Student Folder <a name="StudentFolder">

A python class created according to decorator methods. The main goals
is training create python classes, use decorators practices, realize fundamentals
calculus and deliver a faculty exercise.

### Stack Folder <a name="StackFolder">

The stack is one of the most used data structures in many applications. This structure follows the LIFO (Last-in,
First-out) rule. In the stack folder you can see an implementation example making use of linked list and python.
Basically the idea is to build a task stack in order to use the UUID as the fake ID of task. Time is also added to
the task deadline using tools of DateTime class.
